# Game Plan

### Breakout Variant
I am going to do a variation of the Super Breakout game. I thought this variation was interesting because I played this game a lot as a kid and really loved the large amount of power ups.
### General Level Descriptions
Each new level will appear after the player clears the one before it. They layout of the blocks and the placement of the power ups will be random. 
The player will lose when the ball falls past the paddle at the bottom of the screen. If the player completes all of the levels, the player wins the game. 
### Blocks Ideas
I plan to use rectangle blocks of various colors bases on the type of block. All of the blocks have the possibility of holding a power up. 
1) The regular blocks will only need to be hit once. 
2) "Wood" blocks that will need to be hit two times
3) "Metal" blocks that will need to be hit three times.                                                                                                                                                                        
### Power Up Ideas
I plan on implementing the following power ups: 
1) One that will increase the length of the pad for a limited amount of hits
2) One that will "blow up" the block it hits and its surrounding blocks. 
3) One that will add more balls into game play. In this case, the player will only lose when the last ball falls past the paddle. 
4) One that will act as a negitive power up. It will add more blocks to the level. In this case the player will have to recognize the power up and attempt to avoid catching it. 
### Cheat Key Ideas
I will add the following cheat keys:
1) 'L' will allow the player to return to the point of the game where they lost
2) 'R' will reset the ball and the paddle to their starting position
3) '1-9': when the player presses a numeric key, clear the current level and jump to the level corresponding to the number pressed (or the highest one that exists)
4) I will also add a key that will increase the size of the paddle
 
### Something Extra
I plan to add a points system to the game. Each time a block is hit the player will get a certain amount of points. I'll implement a system where the amount of points given increases if the player is able to hit a series of blocks with one hit of the paddle. There will be a points display on the screen so the player can see their score. 
I think that this is a substantial addition because it will motivate the player to play as efficiently as possible. My hope is that they wil try to find ways to hit as many blocks as possible: keeping the game interesting.
